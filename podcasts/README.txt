To run the audio differ, you need to download the podcatss to this folder, such that the structure looks like this example:

.
└── _podcasts
    ├── eng
    ├── nor
    └── tor
    
With podcasts in the correct folders.

Then simply run massAudioDiff from the command line while in the podcasts directory.

If you want a custom length of the audio files, that can be given as a second argument to the program.
